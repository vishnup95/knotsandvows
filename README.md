# Ahwanam Consumer Portal ‚öõÔ∏èüé®

**What's included:**

- Server-side rendering with code splitting.
- Redux (with server-side data fetching/store population)
- React Router v4
- Conditionally load pollyfills -- only ship bloat to outdated browsers
- React Helmet for dynamic manipulation of the document `<head />`
- Dev server with hot-reloading
- Jest and Enzyme config ready to test the crap out of some stuff
- CSS Modules, Sass, and autoprefixer
- Run-time environment variables
- Node.js clusters for improved performance under load (in production)
- Prettier and ESLint run on commit


## Initial setup

- `npm install`

## Development
- Creating environment variables
  - Copy the content of sample-env.txt file and create a .env file in route folder

- `npm start`
  - Start the dev server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm test`
  - Start `jest` in watch mode

## Production

- `npm run build && npm run start-prod`
  - Bundle the JS and fire up the Express server for production


## Current Quirks

- This app does **not** create a server bundle via webpack, only client-side bundles. That means some of the crazy things you can do with webpack (`import`ing images, for example) are not possible here without getting dirty.
- CSS modules are disabled for any files inside `src/styles` -- use this directory for global styles instead. This is configured in the webpack config files, so start there if you'd like to change anything.
- Routing configuration can potentially be _slightly_ duplicated. All routes should be defined in their normal React Router v4 fashion. However, any routes that need to have data fetched before rendering (on the server) need some extra configuration inside `sever/fetchDataForRender` (in the `ROUTES_THAT_FETCH_DATA` array).
